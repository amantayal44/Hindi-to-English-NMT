# Hindi-to-English-NMT
done as a cs779 (Natural Language Processing) course project

Experimented various Neural Machine translation models for hindi to english translation in different phases

- phase 1 - tested seq2seq model on different RNN layers such as LSTM, GRU, Bidirectional GRU, LSTM with 2 layers
- phase 2 - tested on seq2seq model with bidirectional GRU encoder and GRU decoder on different hyperparameters such as embedding size, hidden dimension size, initialization
- phase 3 - implemented attention layer with and without residual connection
- phase 4 - implemented transformer model with beam search for inference


Results of all phases are shown in final [report](report.pdf)
